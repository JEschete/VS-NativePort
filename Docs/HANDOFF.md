# Handoff: prologue entry and shared rendering

## Current checkpoint

The ordered work tracker is [#4](https://github.com/JEschete/VS-NativePort/issues/4).
The maintained-production quality pass in [#5](https://github.com/JEschete/VS-NativePort/issues/5)
is verified locally. The Guildenstern textbox fix in
[#1](https://github.com/JEschete/VS-NativePort/issues/1) is now verified locally;
menu rendering in #2 remains the next ordered gameplay task.
Preserve the original dialogue pause and button advance; do not shorten the scene delay.

### Guildenstern window dialogue (2026-10-19)

Verification used `35618ef2` plus the feedback-link fix and renderer regression.
The original line is **"...Where are you, Sydney?"**, not "Where are you hiding Sydney?".

- A hardware write watch identified F02456, `Effects_ScreenDistortion_DrawFeedbackTiles`
  (`SCREFF2.PRG func_800F986C`, `src/GIM/SCREFF2.PRG/0.c`), writing native address bits
  into ordering entry 143. The invalid link terminated rendering before the textbox chain.
  Both the feedback and framebuffer-restore links now use `LegacyGpu_Handle`, through
  `copy_fixups.py`. The original effect, event delay and controller wait are unchanged.
- The regression in the existing GIM renderer tests checks both framebuffer buffers,
  feedback depths 1, 2 and 128, both links, packet-buffer guards and complete traversal
  through a lower dialogue packet. `[render][text][feedback]` passes all six combinations;
  all 19 `[render]` cases pass (200 assertions) in Debug and Release. The complete Debug
  suite passes 96 cases / 30713 assertions.
- Clean Debug New Game replay: `VS.Desktop.exe --frames 10000 --speed 16 --press
  1000:Start,1300:Circle,3800:Circle,3980:Circle,4160:Circle,4340:Circle,4520:Circle,
  4700:Circle,4880:Circle,5060:Circle,5240:Circle,6400:Circle --capture
  build/quality/issue1-window-final --at 6000,6300,6450,7000,8500,9900 --scripted
  --log-level debug --log-channels boot,input,content,render`. Join the wrapped
  `--press` list without whitespace. The line is visibly present at 6000 and 6300;
  Circle at 6400 advances into ZONE002 at 6450 and MAP002 at 6486. Later ZONE003/MAP003
  loads at 8757/8793. Exit 0. No event flags or timing were bypassed.
- Logs: `build/Debug/issue1-window-final.log` and `-stderr.log`; rendered captures:
  `build/quality/issue1-window-final/`. Earlier before/fixed captures and the write-watch
  stack remain under `build/quality/issue1-window-*` and
  `build/Debug/issue1-dialog-write-watch-stderr.log`. Temporary probes are removed.
- Release repeats the same input schedule with `--frames 7000 --capture
  build/quality/issue1-window-release --at 6000,6300,6990`; the line is visually verified
  at 6300 and the same Circle-driven ZONE002/MAP002 transition occurs at 6450/6486.
  Exit 0; logs are `build/Debug/issue1-window-release.log` and `-stderr.log`.
- A second `copy_to_native.py` run preserves manifest SHA-256
  `D52C8D3AE62F712540F2499CAB05D74EE96E8558CDB7790B3AF2D8041111E5E3`.
- `quality-native.cmd --changed --tidy`: zero new findings; no baseline refresh.
  Existing uninitialized actor-dialog `texture` warning is separate and not claimed fixed.
  This verifies the window dialogue, not full scene-rendering parity or the prologue.
- Latest pushed Source Quality run `39239821866` is successful for `35618ef2`.
  The fixing commit and closure evidence are recorded in #1. No push was performed for
  the window-dialogue fix.

### Menu copy helpers and quick test route (2026-10-19)

Issue #19 supports the active menu-rendering issue #2. Verification used `5694a3d3`
plus the owned halfword-copy implementations and memory regressions.

- F04188/F04189 are implemented in `Core/Memory/WordCopy.c`, not generated output.
  Original `573B8.c:242-269` copies leading halfwords, then loads four halfwords before
  storing each eight-byte block. The native code preserves that forward overlap order,
  halfword alignment and full native pointer bytes. Nonpositive sizes are no-ops;
  incomplete halfwords/blocks are ignored rather than entering invalid assembly loops.
  The header declarations now have C linkage for native C++ consumers.
- Before repair, the new direct copy tests failed 25 assertions in three cases, leaving
  destinations unchanged: `build/Debug/issue19-before-test.log`. After repair,
  `[core][memory]` passes six cases / 141 assertions in Debug and Release. The complete
  Debug suite passes 100 cases / 30805 assertions. Changed-source quality with tidy
  reports zero new findings; no baseline refresh.
- Use real Start presses to skip the opening and the A. J. Durai quote for menu testing:
  `--press 1000:Start,1300:Circle,3000:Start,4000:Start,7000:Triangle` loads MAP009 at
  4058 and MAINMENU.PRG at 7005. Start at 1500 is too early in this replay. Repeated
  Circle inputs can open/close the battle sphere instead of testing the main menu.
  Keep the complete prologue for combat troubleshooting and verification.
- Menu/preview replay in both configurations: `--frames 10000 --speed 16 --press
  1000:Start,1300:Circle,3000:Start,4000:Start,7000:Triangle,7600:Circle,8200:Down,8500:Circle
  --at 7500,7900,8400,9000,9900 --scripted`. Debug captures/logs use
  `issue19-firstroom-preview`; Release uses `issue19-firstroom-preview-release`
  (Release captures at 7500,8400,9900). Captures are under `build/quality/`; logs are
  under `build/Debug/`, including `-stderr.log`. Both exit 0. The item preview renders
  Ashley without the observed companion-slot corruption; the trace remains at slot 1.
- Main menu text/graphics still render as black bars and are NOT claimed fixed.
  Issue #2 remains active. The copy-helper fixing commit and CI/closure evidence are
  recorded in #19; the main-menu renderer is the next controlling path to inspect.

### Native menu rendering and workspace (2026-10-19)

Verification used pushed `e4442056` plus the pending row/workspace changes. #2 is
still active; its native workspace defect is #27 and the Status crash is #28.

- F01348 used PS1 scratch offset `+0x008`, which is the scene ordering pointer in the
  native frame rather than the overlay pointer. It now accesses the native fields and
  uses a packet handle. F02548's scrolling gradient also now uses a native handle.
  Root menu labels/gradients, setup labels and return to gameplay are visually verified.
- #27: F01367 allocates `40 * sizeof(Menu_Framework_MenuRow) + 0x124`, places string
  scratch after the forty rows, then row-type scratch 96 bytes later. F01349 clears the
  same native-sized workspace. Original PS1 `0xB24/+0xA00/+0xA60` sizes overlapped the
  native rows after pointer growth. Fixes are in the copier, not direct generated edits.
- Existing GIM render tests check normal and scrolling link traversal, separate scene
  and overlay tables, packet bounds, and real menu initialization of the final native
  row and all scratch bytes with two guards. `[render][menu]`: two cases / three checks.
  Release `[render]`: 21 cases / 203 assertions. Full Debug: 102 cases / 30808 assertions.
  Changed-source quality with tidy: zero new findings; no baseline refresh.
- Debug menu/item/setup/return inputs: `1000:Start,1300:Circle,3000:Start,4000:Start,
  7000:Triangle,7600:Circle,8200:Down,8500:Circle,9200:Cross,9600:Cross,10000:Triangle`.
  Both configurations complete 11500 ticks at speed 16, with stable preview companion
  slot 1. Debug captures: `build/quality/issue2-items-row-after`; Release captures:
  `build/quality/issue27-release-menu-return`; corresponding logs are in `build/Debug/`.
  Root-only restored capture: `build/quality/issue2-mainmenu-row-after/frame_8100.png`.
- Second copier run is stable: manifest SHA-256
  `8887CF7992242337205C67EDDA97A0F69906119AE435A740E3906E19A6D39E4F`.
- Remaining: item overview/category row/detail text is still absent despite visible
  category icons and Ashley preview. Status entry (`7500:Down,7800:Circle` after the
  same menu-open inputs) crashes in nested `Render_FormatEncodedText` at tick 7833;
  logged before repair as #28, evidence `build/Debug/issue2-status-release-stderr.log`.
  Passing unit tests and root-menu screenshots do not establish completion of #2.
  Fixing commit/CI and closure evidence for the narrower workspace repair are in #27.

### Quality verification (2026-10-19)

Verification used `work` at `3c0a1311` plus the pending retained-code cleanup. No baseline
refresh was used, and no commits were pushed during this work.

- Full `tools/lint/quality.py --tidy`: **zero actionable native-production findings** and
  zero new findings. Remaining counts are 332 test-harness, 154 tooling and 13 legacy
  SDK-name/signature/null-spelling diagnostics. Test/tooling follow-up is #25; compatibility
  retirement remains #18. Exact fixture literals and replacement-only style are reported
  separately, not described as fixed code. See [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) for the explicit policy.
- Complete Debug and Release solution builds pass. Each full `VS.Tests.exe --reporter compact`
  run passes **95 test cases / 30707 assertions**. All **23 quality-tool controls** pass.
- `check_native_views.py`, `layout_check.py` and `check_event_dispatch.py` pass. Running
  `copy_to_native.py` again leaves the copier manifest SHA-256 unchanged.
- Release replay: `--frames 14000 --speed 16 --press 1000:Start --capture
  build/quality/final-release-replay --at 1500,6000,13900 --scripted --log-level info` completes
  and produces all captures. A corresponding Debug frame at tick 13900 was visually inspected:
  actor geometry and dialogue are visible. This is regression evidence, not complete gameplay parity.
- Evidence is under `build/Debug/issue5-final-*` and `build/quality/`. Release logs also live
  under `build/Debug/` because the bounded runner uses that common log directory.

### Verified defects and remaining limits

- #20: SEQ decoder int-alias/alignment defect, fixed in `7da0da5b`; halfword-aligned vectors,
  packed signed deltas and rotation/cursor rules are tested.
- #21: unrepresentable disc-read byte counts, fixed in `c8516e00`; rejection preserves request state.
- #22: signed squared-length overflow in normalization, reproduced before fixing in `5ab86b63`;
  full-range positive/negative vectors, zero input, aliasing and padding are tested.
- #23: manifest sector-range overflow, fixed in `4dfd783b`; synthetic boundary entries avoid
  large-file allocations and share the same arithmetic as real lookup/read paths.
- #24: GPU upload byte-count overflow and partial resize ownership, fixed in `3c0a1311`;
  CPU boundary tests and real presentation pass. Allocation failure handling was reviewed,
  not fault-injected.
- #3: pushed Source Quality failure at `54290b05` is fixed locally by `c41dd5b2`; it remains
  recorded historically. Fresh inspection confirms successful run `39239821866` for
  pushed `35618ef2`. No commits were pushed during the window-dialogue fix. Commit
  permission does not imply push permission.
- #19: the two owned halfword-copy helpers are implemented and verified as recorded
  above. This resolves a dependency of #2, not the remaining missing menu graphics.
- Enemy combat completion, sound, item/spell use, chains, Break Arts, drops, equipment and
  final arena coverage remain open in #6-#16. Follow #4's order rather than treating this
  quality checkpoint as gameplay completion.

## Previous prologue checkpoint (superseded)

Prologue combat entry and remaining intro regressions are the active priority. The older
tick-5751 stopping point below is historical, not the current runtime baseline.

- Debug and Release desktop/test targets build. Both full suites pass **66 tests / 30505 assertions**.
- Required module initialization reports **334 data entries, 19 pointer tables, 2991 symbols,
  50 modules, zero failures**. Copies and relocations validate source extents, destination capacities,
  and reviewed native element strides; unresolved required data prevents startup.
- Native views: **590 fields, zero mismatches**. Layout check: **514 types, zero pointer-free
  mismatches, 78 pointer-bearing differences, zero parse errors**. Event dispatch: **179 signatures,
  zero errors**, including both 256-entry tables. A second copier run leaves all generated content
  hashes unchanged.
- Shared room/sky and normal actor geometry now render. Owned scalar/matrix math, native model
  workspace, bone transforms/projection, encoded text, and native ordering links have focused tests.
  Packet decoding rejects truncated commands and cyclic lists instead of reading beyond packets.
- Facial ETM loading/release now uses `Actors_sharedSequenceBankTexturePages[slot - 1]`. Original
  `D_800F244F[slot]` and `D_800F2450[slot - 1]` name the same byte; independent native arrays broke
  the loader-to-animation hand-off. Public slots are checked before the one-based conversion.
  Tests cover 4-bit/8-bit frame rectangles, uploaded texels, a nonzero blink frame, frame-zero
  restoration on bank switching/release, and page retirement. Both hand-off and bank-switch tests
  failed before their respective corrections.
- Shared-bank selection now reads named actor fields, not PS1 offsets. The three row bytes read
  by `func_8009CE9C` at actor+0x183E are represented by a union: the third byte retains its original
  overlap with `momentumDistance` at +0x1840. The actor extent and subsequent field offsets are
  unchanged; regression coverage switches to both alternate banks and checks the overlap.
- The second-demo sword-draw stall was an audio-volume wait. Counter 2's callback was discarded by
  the removed `OpenEvent` implementation. It now runs at 240 Hz from logical frames; fades advance
  every fourth callback. The newly reached mixer path also handles an absent saved music layer.
- Room AI allocation and its native-sized flag/height tables are initialized before enemy metadata.
  The two-layer collision sampler now decodes real 4-by-4 patterns and surface flags. The later
  `ActorStatusConditionScore` fault came from the stubbed condition snapshot: the owned producer now
  fills actor IDs, HP, MP, statuses, and equipment DP before scoring. A poisoned-table fixture checks it.
- The first basic attack reproduced a null-menu access in `Battle_CommitSelectedAction` at tick 12621.
  G01904 (`Battle_actionDefinitions`) was excluded from startup loading by incorrect pointer metadata
  and the anonymous hit-record spelling. Its reviewed 52-byte records now load from SLUS offset
  `0x3C1DC`; basic attack 1 has category 14 and body-part targeting, not zero-filled environment targeting.
  Native layout assertions and the real-disc module test check its decoded fields and targeting policy.
- G00229 (`Effects_emptyPackage`, the existing label for the embedded default package) had only its
  four-byte header allocated. The parser walked into unrelated native memory; a relink exposed a
  watchdog stall at tick 1372. It now owns all `0x5200` bytes from BATTLE offset `0x83CBC`: nine tagged
  blocks and the zero terminator at `+0x51FC`. The module regression binds the real package and checks
  texture, animation, timeline, curve, particle, program, parameter, transform, and sound-table data.
- GIM rendering and event views now share the two-byte flag header and native pointer stride.
  `ENKEI.GIM` fills the manor splash rather than displaying a small image over the room. Captures
  at ticks 1600/1800 in `build/new-game-actors` match the supplied full-illustration composition.
- On-disc room-effect command headers remain four bytes, fixing shifted motion/rotation operands.
  Gimmick views expose their native model pointer and use the canonical room scale. Room triangle/quad
  subdivision, adaptive special-model quads, GPU mask packets, and room-light color sampling now have
  focused tests. Actor drawing preserves the update-owned flag and applies signed tint adjustments.
- Debug and Release New Game replays reach **19000 ticks** with dialogue, basic-attack, and directional
  button inputs without the reproduced crash. The final Debug log is `build/Debug/prologue-debug-replay.log`;
  captures and the preserved user playthrough log are in `build/new-game-actors/prologue-input`.
  Release also completes **43000 ticks** across both demos and returns to title. Its event trace is
  `build/Debug/window-event-replay.log`, with captures in `build/facial-textures/window-pause`.
  These accelerated runs are not proof of complete combat or normal-speed timing parity.
- The null-actor movement dump in `Pasted text.md` matched a detached room-spawn alias. The shared
  caller now reads `Field_zoneContext.mpdEnemyCount`; both current binaries contain that correction.

## Reference update review

- Reviewed `resources/rood-reverse` at `2a589e01`, including the latest pull after `c37e3eb2`.
  That batch adds shared trail/ring implementations, effect relinking, ending refactors, and image tools.
  Its battle-path changes rename screen dimensions without changing behavior.
- Actor dispatch already has the native label `Actors_ExecuteQueuedActorCommands` (F00161), and the
  pinned snapshot already includes C implementations of it and shared trail routines. Do not duplicate
  these implementations or replace established native types with another snapshot's layouts.
- `RunActorAiUpdateStages`, `SetActorVerticalMovementSteps`, and `SetDirectMovement` remain assembly-backed
  in the updated upstream on the inspected paths. The local `rood-reverse-noprompt` snapshot also retains
  assembly for those entry points. No reference snapshot was changed or bulk-imported during this review.

## Remaining limits

- The user confirmed that lighting fixes resolved the doubled faces and restored title cards resolved
  the apparent early staging/repeated entrance. Door motion and the full wyvern sequence remain unverified.
  The companion rendering pass is enabled. Material overrides, full lighting/shadows, and broad
  camera/pose parity remain incomplete. The model workspace is sequential and not reentrant.
- The reported extended Guildenstern window pause was not reproduced as a hard stall in the accelerated
  demo trace; the window scene advances and the demos finish. Normal-speed duration and the recording's
  exact interval remain unverified. Do not shorten original script delays or claim this pause fixed.
- `func_800B3A68` does not read its third argument in the original assembly either. The unused native
  `nearOffset` parameter alone is not evidence of a missing clipping operation. Texture scrolling's
  incoming-register comparison also exists in the original assembly; its intended semantics remain
  unresolved and were not guessed during the facial fix.
- The title/battle boundary uses C `setjmp`/`longjmp` after existing cleanup. It must not bypass live
  C++ destructors. Earlier runs observed title re-entry, but this is not complete lifecycle ownership.
- The two human encounters and D'tok are interactive prologue gameplay, not skippable demo segments.
  Validation must drive actual controller actions and check combat/scene state. No enemy defeat,
  HP edit, event-flag bypass, or combat completion was used or claimed in these replays. Higher-level
  navigation, planning, and combat routines still include stubs. The live handoff reaches the unported
  `RunActorAiUpdateStages`, `SetDirectMovement`, and `DrawSphereVolumeWireframe` paths; completing these
  and validating actual target selection/action execution is still required for a playable encounter.
- No full playthrough, collision/combat completion, save support, audio/timing parity, or final
  asset-format conversion is claimed. VS Workshop informs asset layouts but does not execute ETM
  facial overlays or establish runtime visual parity.

## Diagnostics

- `--capture <dir> --at <ticks> --capture-pages` also writes a 1024-by-512 page-space image and raw
  little-endian 16-bit words for each presented capture. `tools/test/decode_pages.ps1` decodes a selected
  4-bit, 8-bit, or direct-color region with its runtime CLUT. Coordinates X/Y are page-space words/rows;
  Width/Height are decoded pixels.
- Optional `texture` and `event-step` debug channels report facial copy selections and event commands.
  Frame presentation may happen on alternating ticks; inspect adjacent render ticks when correlating logs.
- Portable DuckStation captures were collected under `build/ds-render-parity-20261018`; the installed
  emulator and BIOS were not modified. These do not constitute a complete matched-sequence comparison.

## Historical checkpoint

The notes below describe the earlier native-layout/dispatch follow-up based on `218a9b5f`.
Read with `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (rules, machine paths),
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md), [PORTING_WATCHLIST.md](PORTING_WATCHLIST.md) §2/§5/§9 and
[NATIVE_SOURCE_PORT_PLAN.md](NATIVE_SOURCE_PORT_PLAN.md) §6.8.1.

## Rules (owner)

- Never edit generated files. Fixes go into `tools\port\copy_to_native.py` or `tools\port\copy_fixups.py`; hand
  ports go through `python tools\port\own.py <id> --to Native\<Project>\src\<Area>\<File>.c`.
- Never commit a BIOS. x64 layouts: **option B** (per-site fixes, 64-bit pointer members kept).
- Actor/sequence/room work stays on the shared path (plan §6.8.1): Content `ActorAssets.c` (SHP/SEQ/WEP loader),
  `Actors\ActorLoading.c`/`ActorState` (actor handler), `Actors\Animation.c` (sequence handler). Every fix is a
  copy-tool rule on those shared functions, so it applies to every actor.

## Done

- 1b title slice: logos, intro movie, title, menu, load screen (CAUTION label fixed), controller input.
- Tools and `C:\Tools` in the solution (Tools folder); DuckStation/BIOS paths logged; test scripts in `tools\test\`.
- Attract path (commit `d9664700`): on-disc offsets via `VS_ONDISC`, `SIG_RETYPE`, `TYPE_FIXES`, actor record and
  allocation fixes, module pointer tables resolve, debug aids (`Core_Tracef`, `Platform::LogCallStack`,
  `Platform_WatchWrites`, null-call stack reporting), `--speed`.
- After it: `Render::QueueSprite`, `QueueSpriteWithTexturePage`, `QueueDefaultSprite`, `LoadFrameViewMatrix`
  hand-ported from inline assembly (owned, `Native\Engine\src\Render\Sprites.c`). This fixed the
  `Battle_DrawBattleHud` crash (a stub returned null).
- Toggleable logging: `--log-level trace|debug|info|warn|error|off`, `--log-channels ai,actors,...`, and logical
  tick stamps. C diagnostics use `Core_Debugf`; existing `Core_Tracef` is trace-level. See BUILDING §6.
- `Core_Memory_ClearAlignedWords` (F01758 / BATTLE `func_800E4288`, `7B5DC.s:344-367`) is now an owned port in
  `Engine\src\Core\Memory\WordCopy.c`, with assembly provenance and bounds/full-size tests. Unlike SLUS's
  `ZeroAlignedWords`, it does not truncate the size to 16 bits. Nonpositive sizes are a documented native no-op.
- Shared actor/AI views: `tools\port\native_views.py` exposes native pointer slots hidden in PS1 padding,
  including the canonical AI state's position/tile sources and decision callback. Corrected the linked-actor
  byte's MSVC bitfield storage, model-pointer view, and two misleadingly named view families. File layouts are
  unchanged. `check_native_views.py` checks 532 selected non-padding field offsets: **0 mismatches**.
- AI creation (F01818): allocates/clears the full `Battle_Ai_ActorAiState` (1264 native bytes, not the partial
  creation view), uses `RoomAiState.specialActors`, and calls the real tagged-bone signature with `SVECTOR`.
  G00579 has **16 slots** in both definition and header: the next BSS symbol is `tileFlagMap` at 0x800F58B8,
  0x40 bytes after the table at 0x800F5878 (`7E05C.s:541-575`). `0x10` is a linked-actor sentinel, not a slot.
  The copier now applies reviewed fixups to globals synthesized from extern declarations too.
- Effect timelines (F01557/F01589): allocate native-sized tracks and index `timeline->tracks[i]`, instead of
  assuming 16-byte PS1 records. Native stride is 24 bytes; the old sound-track crash at tick 5483 is cleared.
- Event dispatch: all 179 distinct normal/skip handlers (182 catalog rows), tables and interpreter result use `intptr_t`. This includes
  saved-address returns and control-code-only handlers; no incompatible function-pointer casts were added.
  The skip table allocation/copy uses its complete native size (256 pointers), not 0x400 bytes. Actual branches
  at tick 5485 now retain their full native addresses. Debug channels `effects` and `event` log these boundaries.
- Layout/dispatch baseline: Debug and Release each passed **19 tests / 30141 assertions**. Tests cover guarded full AI
  storage and cross-view pointers, two-track timeline indexing, normal/skip branch dispatch, saved returns,
  conditional/backward jumps and thread starts. Release build log: `build\ai-release-build.log`.
- `check_event_dispatch.py` verifies the complete normal/skip handler set and compatible argument/return types
  against the extracted BATTLE.PRG and generated skip initializer: 179 distinct signatures, zero errors.
- Final 1800-tick scripted title/menu run with Down at 1200 and Circle at 1300 exits 0 and produced captures at
  1500/1700 (`build\ai-final-title`); log: `build\ai-final-title.log` (git-ignored).
- CLI smoke checks reject invalid/missing logging values with exit 1; `off` leaves an empty log and still
  captures tick 30; `trace`/`frame` emits begin/end records through tick 30 without info-channel leakage.
- GIM tiles (F01393 / BATTLE `func_800CBBCC`, `5BF94.c:4056`): copy-tool fixes replace the computed PS1 scratch
  address with two native 256-entry coordinate arrays (byte dimensions plus the final boundary), reject grids
  exceeding the 250-entry tile payload, and use `LegacyGpu_Handle` for scaled-quad ordering links. Fixed-point
  coordinate formulas and the shared tile/fade API are unchanged. No generated source was patched by hand.
- GIM follow-up: Debug and Release builds and **25 tests / 30178 assertions** pass. Six new tests exercise
  coordinate rounding, clipping, dimension/tile-table bounds, shared-scratch isolation, packet-buffer guards,
  native links, framebuffer fades and wipe/crossfade fast paths. Regeneration is stable; native-view, layout and
  event-dispatch checks pass. Release build log: `build\gim-release-build.log`.
- Fresh 1800-tick title/menu regression exits 0 with captures at 1500/1700 in
  `build\gim-title-20261018-011630`; log: `build\gim-title-20261018-011630.log`.

## Historical stopping point (superseded)

Run: `tools\test\run_native.ps1 -NoCopy -SkipIntro -Speed 8 -Frames 8000 -At '1500,5400,5500,7900' -LogLevel debug -LogChannels 'ai,actors,effects,event,boot,input,content,render'`
(the demo starts about tick 5300).
Latest log: `build\gim-attract-20261018-011630.log`; captures at 1500/5400/5500 in
`build\gim-attract-20261018-011630`. The former tick-5487 GIM fault is cleared, with no GIM grid-rejection
diagnostics in this run. The tick-7900 capture is still not reached.
Ashley initialization returns at tick 5363; scripted actors 2/3/4 report matching native/view IDs at
5371/5381/5391. They now take the intended no-AI path according to their actor flags. Loads ZONE020.ZND,
MAP213.MPD, HEADQUAT.GIM and E229.P; playback now advances to **tick 5751**:

**Next investigation:** the shared actor/SEQ animation-header lookup. The failing read is
`VS_ONDISC(p, animationMap, u_char *)[idx]`; trace the selected sequence pointer, on-disc offset and index before
choosing a fix. This later animation failure was not repaired as part of the GIM work.

The runner correctly rejects this run with exit `-1073741819` (0xC0000005); the requested tick-7900 capture is
not reached. Wrappers that catch this expected exception may exit 0: that is **not** gameplay success.
The earlier actor-ID, effect-stride, event-return and GIM scratch failures are cleared; **the attract run still fails**.

Validation limits: the 532-field checker audits selected offsets, not all widths/strides or every runtime view.
The model-family slot list covers only the reviewed early model/sequence region, not the entire ActorRecord.
`layout_check.py` reports 519 checked types, zero pointer-free mismatches, 80 expected pointer-bearing layout
differences and zero parse errors. No full AI simulation, visual-fidelity comparison or real-time A/V validation
is claimed. AI room/relations/locomotion prerequisites remain stubs; downstream planning workspace offsets
remain unreviewed. The initialization log's height 65397 is the creation view's unsigned representation of -139,
not proof of correct collision behavior. No further assembly functions were ported in this layout slice.

## Stubs reached at the historical checkpoint

From the log (`[warn] [tick=N] unported:`). Assembly lives in `resources\rood-reverseWin\src\...` (`.s` files) or the
`INCLUDE_ASM` splat output under `resources\rood-reverseWin\build\splat-artifacts\`.

| Stub | Catalog | Assembly | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Core::ElapsedFrameCounterTicks` | SLUS | root counter (hardware): modernize to a frame timer; returns 0 now = always within AI budget | tiny |
| `Core::Math::MultiplyMatrixIntoRight` | F03415 | `SLUS_010.40\32154.s` | small (GTE) |
| `Field::SampleCollisionHeightCode` | F00772 | `BATTLE\BATTLE.PRG\2EA3C.s` | small |
| `Render::SetRoomPolygonNearClip` | F00753 | `2EA3C.s` | small |
| `Render::BuildRoomGeometryViewMatrix` | F00759 | `2EA3C.s` | medium |
| `Render::DrawSkyDome` | F00757 | `2EA3C.s` | medium |
| `Battle::Ai::InitializeRoomAiMap` | F01838 | `BATTLE\BATTLE.PRG\7E05C.s` | medium |

| `Actors::DrawActorModel` | F01023 | `func_800B28A8.s` (INCLUDE_ASM) | ~1150 lines |

Room/actor geometry was not implemented at that checkpoint. The current shared normal-material path and its
remaining limitations are described above. Raw offsets still in code reached later are listed in
PORTING_WATCHLIST §2 (Option B).
